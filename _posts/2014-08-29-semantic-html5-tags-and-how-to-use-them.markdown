## What is a semantic tag?

Here are a few examples of semantic html tags:

~~~html
  <header>, <nav>, <article>, <img>, <h1>
~~~

- Semantic tags clearly define the purpouse and meaning of content inside of them.

##### In the codepen below is an example of semantic html code:

<p data-height="268" data-theme-id="8166" data-slug-hash="qkEbt" data-default-tab="result" class='codepen'>See the Pen <a href='http://codepen.io/tryggvigy/pen/qkEbt/'>qkEbt</a> by Tryggvi Gylfason (<a href='http://codepen.io/tryggvigy'>@tryggvigy</a>) on <a href='http://codepen.io'>CodePen</a>.</p>
<script async src="//codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>

## So what is NOT semantic HTML code?

~~~html
  <div>, <span>
~~~

- Some tags do not "tell" you anything about the content inside of them, these tags are "non-semantic"
or "presentation only" tags.

- There is nothing _wrong_ with using these tags and in fact can often be very useful and are widely used.

- The reasoning behind using semantic HTML tags is to
avoid "div-hell" on webpages.


## Lessons learned

Think twice about the tags you use.

When writing HTML, try to use the tag that makes the most sense. This will make your code more readable.

Good luck with project 1!
