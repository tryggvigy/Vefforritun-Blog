Hey there!

My name is Tryggvi and I study software engineering at the [University of Iceland](http://www.hi.is)

My email: [trg8@hi.is](http://www.postur.hi.is)

On this site I will post stuff related to web development. I'll try to post as often as I can,
but I have to do my homework too!

Carry on!

Thanks for reading!
